   - Edge cases handled
   - Requirements met

3. **Testing**
   - Test coverage adequate
   - Tests meaningful and correct
   - Edge cases tested

4. **Security**
   - No obvious vulnerabilities
   - Sensitive data handling
   - Input validation

5. **Performance**

### Review Comments

```markdown
# Levels of feedback

# 🔴 Blocking - Must be addressed
This introduces a security vulnerability. User input is not sanitized
before being used in the SQL query.

# 🟡 Suggestion - Should consider
Consider extracting this logic into a separate function for reusability
and testing.

# 🟢 Nit - Minor issue
Nit: This variable name could be more descriptive.
`data` → `userProfileData`

# 💡 Question - Seeking understanding
Question: What's the reasoning behind using a Map here instead of an Object?

# 👍 Praise - Positive feedback
Nice catch handling the edge case where the array might be empty!
```

## Merge Strategies

### Merge Commit

```bash
# Creates a merge commit, preserves all history
git checkout main
git merge --no-ff feature/my-feature

# Result:
#   * Merge branch 'feature/my-feature'
#   |\
#   | * feat: add feature part 2
#   | * feat: add feature part 1
#   |/
#   * Previous main commit
```

**Use when:**
- Want to preserve complete branch history
- Complex features with meaningful intermediate commits
- Audit trail required

### Squash and Merge

```bash
# Combines all commits into one
git checkout main
git merge --squash feature/my-feature
git commit -m "feat: complete feature implementation"

# Result:
#   * feat: complete feature implementation
#   * Previous main commit
```

**Use when:**
- Feature branch has messy history
- WIP commits, fixups, "oops" commits
- Want clean linear history

### Rebase and Merge

```bash
# Replays commits on top of main
git checkout feature/my-feature
git rebase main
git checkout main
git merge --ff-only feature/my-feature

# Result:
#   * feat: add feature part 2
#   * feat: add feature part 1
#   * Previous main commit
```

**Use when:**
- Clean commit history in feature branch
- Each commit is meaningful and tested
- Want linear history without merge commits

### Comparison

| Strategy | History | Complexity | Traceability |
|----------|---------|------------|--------------|
| Merge | Preserved | High | High |
| Squash | Combined | Low | Medium |
| Rebase | Linear | Low | Medium |

gh pr view 123

# Request review
gh pr edit 123 --add-reviewer "@reviewer1,@reviewer2"

# Mark ready for review
gh pr ready 123

# Convert to draft

gh pr close 123
```

### Handling Stale PRs

```yaml
# .github/workflows/stale.yml
name: Mark Stale PRs

on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 0 * * *'  # Daily

jobs:
  stale:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/stale@v9
        with:
          repo-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          stale-pr-message: 'This PR has been inactive for 14 days. Please update or close.'
          days-before-stale: 14
          days-before-close: 7
          stale-pr-label: 'stale'
```

## Conflict Resolution

### Before Merging

```bash
# Update feature branch with latest main
git checkout feature/my-feature
git fetch origin
git rebase origin/main

# If conflicts occur
# 1. Edit conflicting files
# 2. Stage resolved files
git add <resolved-file>
# 3. Continue rebase
git rebase --continue

# Force push (only on feature branches!)
git push --force-with-lease
```

### Merge Conflicts in PR

```bash
# Option 1: Rebase (preferred for clean history)
git checkout feature/my-feature
git fetch origin
git rebase origin/main
# Resolve conflicts
git push --force-with-lease

# Option 2: Merge main into feature
git checkout feature/my-feature
git merge origin/main
# Resolve conflicts
git commit
git push
```

### Complex Conflicts

```bash
# Use a merge tool
git mergetool

# Or use specific tool
git mergetool --tool=vscode
git mergetool --tool=meld

# Configure default tool
git config --global merge.tool vscode
git config --global mergetool.vscode.cmd 'code --wait $MERGED'
```

## PR Analytics

### Metrics to Track

1. **PR Size**: Average lines changed
2. **Review Time**: Time from creation to first review
3. **Time to Merge**: Creation to merge
4. **Review Rounds**: Number of change requests
5. **Throughput**: PRs merged per week

### GitHub Insights

```bash
# List PR stats
gh pr list --state merged --json number,title,createdAt,mergedAt,additions,deletions

# PR age analysis
gh pr list --state open --json number,createdAt | jq 'map({number, age: (now - (.createdAt | fromdateiso8601)) / 86400})'
```

## Review Thread Management

### Replying to Review Threads

When addressing review feedback, reply directly to the thread (not a new comment):

```bash
# Find the thread ID for a comment
gh api repos/OWNER/REPO/pulls/NUMBER/comments \
  --jq '.[] | {id, node_id, body}'

# Reply to a review thread via GraphQL
gh api graphql -f query='
  mutation($body: String!, $threadId: ID!) {
    addPullRequestReviewThreadReply(input: {
      body: $body,
      pullRequestReviewThreadId: $threadId
    }) {
      comment { id }
    }
  }' \
  -f body="Fixed in commit abc123" \
  -f threadId="PRRT_xxxxx"
```

### Resolving Review Threads

After addressing feedback and pushing fixes:

```bash
# Resolve a review thread
gh api graphql -f query='
  mutation($threadId: ID!) {
    resolveReviewThread(input: {threadId: $threadId}) {
      thread { isResolved }
    }
  }' \
  -f threadId="PRRT_xxxxx"

# List unresolved threads
gh api graphql -f query='
  query($owner: String!, $repo: String!, $pr: Int!) {
    repository(owner: $owner, name: $repo) {
      pullRequest(number: $pr) {
        reviewThreads(first: 50) {
          nodes {
            id
            isResolved
            comments(first: 1) {
              nodes { body }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }' -f owner=OWNER -f repo=REPO -F pr=NUMBER
```

## Merge Requirements Checklist

Before merging any PR, verify ALL requirements:

### Pre-Merge Checklist

- [ ] **All review threads resolved** - No unresolved conversations
- [ ] **Copilot review complete** (if assigned) - Wait for automated review
- [ ] **Branch rebased on target** - No merge commits in PR branch
- [ ] **All CI checks pass** - Green status on all required checks
- [ ] **No CI annotations** - Check job annotations, not just pass/fail (see below)
- [ ] **Signed commits** - All commits in PR are signed

### Check Programmatically

```bash
# Get PR merge requirements status
gh pr view NUMBER --json \
  reviewDecision,\
  mergeStateStatus,\
  mergeable,\
  statusCheckRollup

# Expected for merge-ready:
# reviewDecision: APPROVED
# mergeStateStatus: CLEAN
# mergeable: MERGEABLE
# statusCheckRollup: all SUCCESS

# Check for CI annotations (warnings that don't fail the check)
gh api "repos/{owner}/{repo}/commits/SHA/check-runs" \
  --jq '.check_runs[] | select(.output.annotations_count > 0) | {name: .name, annotations: .output.annotations_count}'
```

> **Important:** CI checks can PASS while emitting warning annotations (e.g., actionlint/shellcheck via reviewdog, CodeQL deprecation notices). These are invisible in the PR summary view but visible in the job detail "Annotations" section. Always check for annotations before declaring a PR clean.

## Signed Commits with Rebase Merge

### The Problem

When a repository requires:
1. Signed commits AND
2. Only rebase merge (no merge commits, no squash)

GitHub **cannot** sign rebased commits automatically:

```bash
gh pr merge 123 --rebase
# Error: Base branch requires signed commits.
# Rebase merges cannot be automatically signed by GitHub.
```

### The Solution: Local Fast-Forward Merge

Since commits are already signed locally, merge locally and push:

```bash
# 1. Ensure local main is up to date
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# 2. Verify feature branch is rebased (should be fast-forward)
git log --oneline main..feature-branch

# 3. Fast-forward merge (preserves original signatures)
git merge feature-branch --ff-only

# 4. Push to main
git push origin main

# 5. Close the PR (it will auto-close if commits match)
# Or manually: gh pr close NUMBER
```

### Why This Works

- Original commits retain their GPG/SSH signatures
- Fast-forward merge doesn't create new commits
- GitHub recognizes the commits and auto-closes the PR

### When to Use

| Scenario | Solution |
|----------|----------|
| Signed commits required + squash allowed | `gh pr merge --squash` (GitHub signs) |
| Signed commits required + merge commit allowed | `gh pr merge --merge` (GitHub signs merge commit) |
| Signed commits required + rebase only | Local fast-forward merge (this solution) |

### Automation Option

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# merge-signed-pr.sh - Merge PR with signed commits via fast-forward

PR_NUMBER=$1
BRANCH=$(gh pr view $PR_NUMBER --json headRefName -q '.headRefName')

git fetch origin
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# Verify it's a fast-forward
if ! git merge-base --is-ancestor main origin/$BRANCH; then
    echo "Error: Branch needs rebase first"
    exit 1
fi

git merge origin/$BRANCH --ff-only
git push origin main

echo "PR #$PR_NUMBER merged via fast-forward"
```
