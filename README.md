HashiCorp IS has identified a need to develop a purpose built tool to assist our engagements and customers during a TFE to TFC migration.

## Overview

This tool has been develop to assist HashiCorp Implementation Services and customer engagements during an migration of TFE to TFC(or another TFE). Having a tool allows us the ability to offer a standardized offering to our customers.

## Installation

Binaries are created as part of a release, check out the [Release Page](https://github.com/hashicorp-services/tfm/releases) for the latest version.

## Pre-Requisites

`tfm` utilize a config file OR environment variables.

### Config File

A HCL file with the following is the minimum located at `/home/user/.tfm.hcl` or specified by `--config config_file`.

```hcl
sourceHostname="tf.local.com"
sourceOrganization="companyxyz"
sourceToken="<user token from source TFE/TFC with owner permissions>"
destinationHostname="app.terraform.io"
destinationOrganization="companyxyz"
destinationToken="<user token from destination TFE/TFC with owner permissions>"
```

## Workspace List

As part of the HCL config file (`/home/user/.tfm.hcl`), a list of workspaces from the source TFE can be specified. `tfm` will use this list when running `tfm copy workspaces` and ensure the workspace exists or is created in the target.

```hcl
#List of Workspaces to create/check are migrated across to new TFC
"workspaces" = [
  "appAFrontEnd",
  "appABackEnd",
  "appBDataLake",
  "appBInfra"
]

```

## Assign Agent Pools to Workspaces

As part of the HCL config file (`/home/user/.tfm.hcl`), a list of `source-agent-pool-ID=destination-agent-pool-ID` can be provided. `tfm` will use this list when running `tfm copy workspaces --agents` to look at all workspaces in the source host with the assigned source agent pool ID and assign the matching named workspace in the destination with the mapped destination agent pool ID.

```hcl
# A list of source=destination agent pool IDs TFM will look at each workspace in the source for the source agent pool ID and assign the matching workspace in the destination the destination agent pool ID.
agents-map = [
  "apool-DgzkahoomwHsBHcJ=apool-vbrJZKLnPy6aLVxE",
  "apool-DgzkahoomwHsBHc3=apool-vbrJZKLnPy6aLVx4",
  "apool-DgzkahoomwHsB125=apool-vbrJZKLnPy6adwe3",
  "test=beep"
]
```

## Copy Variable Sets

To copy ALL variable sets from the source to the destination run the command:
`tfm copy varsets`

To copy only desired variable sets, provide an HCL list in the `.tfm.hcl` configuration file using the snyntax `"source-varset-name=destination-varset-name"`. This list will be converted to a map. tfm will copy only the source variable sets provided on the left side of the `=`. The right side of the `=` can optionally be a different name to allow you to copy the variable set with a new name. Both sides of the `=` must be populated and `varsets-map` cannot be empty if it is defined.

Example configuration file:

```hcl
varsets-map = [
  "Azure-creds=New-Azure-Creds",
  "aws-creds2=New-AWS-Creds",
  "SourceVarSet=DestVarSet"
 ]
 ```

## Assign VCS

As part of the HCL config file (`/home/user/.tfm.hcl`), a list of `source-vcs-oauth-ID=destination-vcs-oauth-id-ID` can be provided. `tfm` will use this list when running `tfm copy workspaces --vcs` to look at all workspaces in the source host with the assigned source VCS oauth ID and assign the matching named workspace in the destination with the mapped destination VCS oauth ID.

```hcl
# A list of source=destination VCS oauth IDs. TFM will look at each workspace in the source for the source VCS oauth ID and assign the matching workspace in the destination with the destination VCS oauth ID.
vcs-map=[
  "ot-5uwu2Kq8mEyLFPzP=ot-coPDFTEr66YZ9X9n",
  "ot-gkj2An452kn2flfw=ot-8ALKBaqnvj232GB4",

]
```

## Assign SSH

As part of the HCL config file (`/home/user/.tfm.hcl`), a list of `source-ssh-key-id=destination-ssh-key-id` can be provided. `tfm` will use this list when running `tfm copy workspaces --ssh` to look at all workspaces in the source host with the assigned source SSH key ID and assign the matching named workspace in the destination with the mapped SSH key ID.

```hcl
# A list of source=destination VCS oauth IDs. TFM will look at each workspace in the source for the source VCS oauth ID and assign the matching workspace in the destination with the destination VCS oauth ID.
ssh-map=[
  "sshkey-sPLAKMcqnWtHPSgx=sshkey-CRLmPJpoHwsNFAoN",
]
```

### Environment Variables

If no config file is found, the following environment variables can be set or used to override existing config file values.

```bash
export SOURCEHOSTNAME="tf.local.com"
export SOURCEORGANIZATION="companyxyz"
export SOURCETOKEN="<user token from source TFE/TFC with owner permissions>"
export DESTINATIONHOSTNAME="app.terraform.io"
export DESTINATIONORGANIZATION="companyxyz"
export DESTINATIONTOKEN="<user token from source TFE/TFC with owner permissions>"
```

## Docs

Check out our documentation page (coming soon)

## Architectural Decisions Record (ADR)

An architecture decision record (ADR) is a document that captures an important architecture decision made along with its context and consequences.

This project will store ADRs in [docs/ADR](docs/ADR/) as a historical record.

More information about [ADRs](docs/ADR/index.md).

## To build

```bash
make build-local
./tfm -v
```

-or-

```bash
go run . -v
```

## To release

To create a new release of TFM

- Use GitHub Action `Release tfm`
- Specify a version number. Please follow semantic versioning for the release.

This action will do the following steps

- Compile TFM for Linux, Mac, Windows with amd64 and arm64 versions
- Upload the artifacts
- Create a new release + tag on the repo at the current main

## Reporting Issues

If you believe you have found a defect in `tfm` or its documentation, use the [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/hashicorp-services/tfm/issues) to report the problem to the `tfm` maintainers.
