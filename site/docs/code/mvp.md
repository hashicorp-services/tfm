# MVP

Our MVP is defined as a **Migration is accomplished by gathering facts/properties about the SOURCE objects and recreating them in the DESTINATION. Migration is not moving data, it is recreating it.**

## The MVP tool should have the ability to:

- Migrate Workspaces 1 to 1 from source to destination
- Migrate Workspace settings
- Migrate Workspace States
- Migrate Workspace Variables and Variable Sets
- Migrate Workspace Team Access and Permissions
- Assign VCS connections to Destination Workspaces based on a Map provided in the config file
