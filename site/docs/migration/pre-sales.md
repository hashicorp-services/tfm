## Pre-Sales Questionnaire

### Terraform Enterprise, TFE, Current Deployment (Source)
- TFE Version?
- Number of TFE Organizations?
- Number of users/teams using TFE (10/100/1000)?
- Number of workspaces (per organization)?
- Number of Modules in the PMR (per organization)?
- Number of Sentinel Policies/Sets (per organization)? 
- Number of TFE Teams (per organization)?
- Which VCS?
- Is the VCS routable from the internet and serving a publicly trusted certificate?
- Which IdP?
- Where are you deploying infrastructure from TFE today?
- Do you have the ability to run Python scripts or a binary tool from a developer workstation?
- Is there an established maintenance window for transitioning from TFE to TFC?


### Terraform Cloud, TFC, New Deployment (Destination)
- How many TFC Organizations?
- Do you want to migrate everything to TFC?
- Do you require Cloud Agents?
- Will the workspaces all be going into the same Org? 

### Project Flow
The high level Migration path has 6 key components:
1. Discovery
1. Planning
1. Configuration
1. Technical Validation
1. Migration
1. End-User Validation


#### Discovery
- Determine current Terraform Enterprise landscape
    - Version Control Providers (Which VCS, Count, Distribution of Use)
    - Identity Platform (Which IdP, Number of Teams)
    - Modules in the Private Module Registry (Count, Publishing Method, No. of Versions, Frequency of Change)
    - Policies and Policy Sets (Count, Publishing Method, Frequency of Change)
    - Workspaces (Count, Publishing Method, Frequency of Change)
- Inventory Terraform Enterprise footprint (Aids in tracking completed work)
- Establish Workspace criteria required to be eligible for migration
- Determine if Cloud Agents are required (Typically due to on-premise deployments from Terraform)
    - Identify how Cloud Agents are deployed and configured
    - Determine if any utilities are needed within the agent (Local-Exec, Custom Providers, etc...)
- Discuss new user onboarding in Terraform Cloud (Slight differences from Terraform Enterprise)
- Discuss State Migration on Workspaces (Latest State only)
- Evaluate current use of Workspace Variables marked as "sensitive" (these values are read-only from the API)
#### Planning
- Identify Admins of VCS and IdP that will be needed to configure both in Terraform Cloud
- Determine order in which to migrate Modules, Policies, and most importantly Workspaces
- Establish Workspace Migration Timeline and Priority
- Establish Workspace Deprecation process in Terraform Enterprise (Common Options: Locking, Deleting, Archiving)
- Establish Validation process as agreed upon with the Customer
- Determine required API tokens needed for the migration (must have access to all needed Organizations)
    - Terraform Enterprise (Source)
    - Terraform Cloud (Destination)
- Determine if Workspace Code changes are required (Module Sourcing, Provider Initialization)
- Design Cloud Agent Pool structure and required infrastructure, including networking and authentication routes
- Determine how to update destination Workspace Variables that are marked as "sensitive" in the source Workspace
- Establish a control plane to run python from to perform migration tasks (Requires access to both Terraform Enterprise and Terraform Cloud)
#### Configuration
- Configure Terraform Cloud for Version Control
- Configure Terraform Cloud for Single Sign-On
- Create Teams in Terraform Cloud
- (If Needed) Create Cloud Agent Pools, Deploy Agents, and register the Agents with their respective Agent Pool


#### Technical Validation (Proof of Concept)
- Leveraging a subset of Modules, Policies, and Workspaces, migrate enough to verify the migration process
- Test validation steps on the items migrated
#### Migrate
- Perform Migration of Modules in the Private Module Registry, and Validate
- Perform Migration of Sentinel Policies and Policy Sets, and Validate
- Perform Migration of Workspaces in priority order, and Validate
    - Run Plan on Terraform Enterprise
    - Perform any code changes to the Terraform consumed by the Workspace
    - Migrate Workspace to Terraform Cloud
    - Run Plan on Terraform Cloud (verify it matches the Plan from Terraform Enterprise)
    - Validate
    - Deprecation of Terraform Enterprise Workspace
#### End-User Validation
- Verify end users can access and leverage Workspaces in Terraform Cloud as they would have in Terraform Enterprise
