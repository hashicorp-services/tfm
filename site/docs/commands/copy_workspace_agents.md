# tfm copy workspaces --agents

`tfm copy workspaces --agents` or `tfm copy ws --agent` assigns a workspaces' agents from source to destination org.

!!! note ""
    *NOTE: A agent-pool mapping must be provided in TFM's config file  *



As part of the HCL config file (`/home/user/.tfm.hcl`), a list of `source-agent-pool-ID=destination-agent-pool-ID` can be provided. `tfm` will use this list when running `tfm copy workspaces --agents` to look at all workspaces in the source host with the assigned source agent pool ID and assign the matching named workspace in the destination with the mapped destination agent pool ID.

```terraform
# A list of source=destination agent pool IDs TFM will look at each workspace in the source for the source agent pool ID and assign the matching workspace in the destination the destination agent pool ID.
agents-map = [
  "apool-DgzkahoomwHsBHcJ=apool-vbrJZKLnPy6aLVxE",
  "apool-DgzkahoomwHsBHc3=apool-vbrJZKLnPy6aLVx4",
  "apool-DgzkahoomwHsB125=apool-vbrJZKLnPy6adwe3",
  "test=beep"
]
