# tfm copy workspaces

`tfm copy workspaces` or `tfm copy ws` creates a workspaces from source to destination org.

After the workspaces are created at the destination, the next step is to copy the rest of the workspaces settings such as [state](copy_workspace_state.md), [variables](copy_workspace_variables.md), [team access](copy_workspace_teamaccess.md), [remote state sharing](copy_workspace_remote_state_sharing.md) etc using `tfm copy workspace` flags.  

`tfm copy workspaces -h`

```bash
Copy Workspaces from source to destination org

Usage:
  tfm copy workspaces [flags]

Aliases:
  workspaces, ws

Flags:
      --add-prefix string      (optional) Only performed on destination workspaces, adds a prefix, if missing.

      --agents                 Mapping of source Agent Pool IDs to destination Agent Pool IDs in config file
      --consolidate-global     Consolidate global remote state sharing settings. Must be used with --remote-state-sharing flag
      --create-dst-project     Creates destination project, if not existing. Defaults to source organization name.
  -h, --help                   help for workspaces
  -l, --last int               Copy the last X number of state files only.
      --lock                   Lock all source workspaces
      --plan-only              Only plan the copy operation without making changes

      --ssh                    Mapping of source ssh id to destination ssh id in config file
      --state                  Copy workspace states
      --teamaccess             Copy workspace Team Access
      --unlock                 Unlock all source workspaces
      --vars                   Copy workspace variables
      --vcs                    Mapping of source vcs Oauth ID or GitHub App ID to destination vcs Oauth or GitHub App ID in config file
      --workspace-id string    Specify one single workspace ID to copy to destination

Global Flags:
      --autoapprove     Auto approve the tfm run. --autoapprove=true . false by default
      --config string   Config file, can be used to store common flags, (default is ~/.tfm.hcl).
      --json            Print the output in JSON format
```

## Copying Workspaces 
### Copy ALL workspaces

Without providing any flags, `tfm copy workspaces` will copy all source workspaces and create them in the destination organization.

Users will be required to confirm all workspaces is the desired operation if no `workspaces` or `workspaces-map` is not found in tfm config file (eg `~/.tfm.hcl`).

![tfm_cp_ws_confirm](../images/tfm_copy_ws_confirm.png)

To automate the confirmation, the flag `--autoapprove=true` can be provided during a `tfm` run.

![tfm_cp_ws_confirm_autoapprove](../images/tfm_copy_ws_confirm_autoapprove.png)

### Copy a list of workspaces

> **Note:** Only use one of the following: `workspaces`, `exclude-workspaces`, or `workspaces-map`. 

As part of the HCL config file (`/home/user/.tfm.hcl`), a list of workspaces from the source TFE can be specified. `tfm` will use this list when running `tfm copy workspaces` and ensure the workspace exists or is created in the target.

``` terraform
#List of Workspaces to create/check are migrated across to new TFC
"workspaces" = [
  "appAFrontEnd",
  "appABackEnd",
  "appBDataLake",
  "appBInfra"
]
```

### Exclude a list of workspaces

> **Note:** Only use one of the following: `workspaces`, `exclude-workspaces`, or `workspaces-map`. 

As part of the HCL config file (`/home/user/.tfm.hcl`), a list of workspaces to _exclude_ from the source TFE can be specified. `tfm` will use this list when running `tfm copy workspaces` and ensure the workspace is skipped when copying. 

``` terraform
exclude-workspaces = [
  "legacy-frontend",
  "empty-but-remotestatewsenabled"
]
```

## Rename Workspaces in destination during a copy

### Using Workspaces-Map Configuration

> **Note:** Only use one of the following: `workspaces`, `exclude-workspaces`, or `workspaces-map`. 

As part of the HCL config file (`/home/user/.tfm.hcl`), a list of `source-workspace-name=destination-workspace-name` can be provided. `tfm` will use this list when running `tfm copy workspace` to look at all workspaces in the source host and rename the destination workspace name.

> **Note:** Using the 'workspaces-map' configuration in your HCL config file will take precedence over the other 'workspaces' list feature which only lists source workspace names.

```terraform
# A list of source=destination workspace names. TFM will look at each source workspace and recreate the workspace with the specified destination name.
"workspaces-map"=[
  "tfc-mig-vcs-0=tfc-mig-vcs-0",
  "tfc-mig-vcs-1=tfc-mig-vcs-1",
  "tfc-mig-vcs-2=tfc-mig-vcs-2",
  "tfc-mig-vcs-3=tfc-mig-vcs-30",
  "tfc-mig-vcs-4=tfc-mig-vcs-40",
]
```

### Using Prefix and/or Suffix

When migrating workspaces, if wanting to add a prefix and/or suffix to the name, add the following to the command:

`--add-prefix` and/or `--add-suffix`. 

For example `tfm copy workspaces  --add-prefix alpha --add-suffix dev`

- If the workspace is `frontend`, it will create it on the destination as `alpha-frontend-dev`. 

- If the workspace was named `alpha-frontend`, it will only add the suffix `-dev`. 

- If the workspace was `frontend-dev`, it will only add the prefix `alpha-`. 

Example output: 

```
**** Standardizing workspace names with prefix and suffix ****

Renaming workspace:  bravo-dev -> id-bravo-dev
Renaming workspace:  charlie -> id-charlie-dev
Renaming workspace:  id-delta -> id-delta-dev
```


## Existing Workspaces in Destination

Any existing workspaces in the destination will be skipped.

![copy_ws_exist](../images/copy_ws_exists.png)

## Copy Workspaces into Projects

By default, a workspace will be copied over to the Default Project in the destination (eg TFC).
Users can specify the project ID for the desired project to place all workspaces in the `tfm copy workspace` run.

Utilize [`tfm list projects --side destination`](../commands/list_projects.md#side-flag) to determine the `project id`.

Set either the environment variable:

```bast
export DST_TFC_PROJECT_ID=prj-XXXX
```

or specify the following in your `~/.tfm.hcl` configuration file.

```terraform
dst_tfc_project_id=prj-xxx 
```

### Create New Project During Copy

Runs if `--create-dst-project` is specified. 

Checks if the destination project exists. It will attempt to create a project, as long as the name is at least 3 characters long and no more than 40 characters. 

By default, it will attempt to utilize the source organization name.
