# Go Development Patterns

## When to Use

- Building Go services or CLI applications
- Implementing job scheduling or task orchestration
- Integrating with Docker API
- Building LDAP/Active Directory clients
- Designing resilient systems with retry logic
- Setting up comprehensive test suites

## Required Workflow

**For comprehensive reviews, ALWAYS invoke these related skills:**

1. **Security audit** - Invoke `/netresearch-skills-bundle:security-audit` for OWASP analysis, vulnerability assessment, and security patterns
2. **Enterprise readiness** - Invoke `/netresearch-skills-bundle:enterprise-readiness` for OpenSSF Scorecard, SLSA compliance, supply chain security
3. **GitHub project setup** - Invoke `/netresearch-skills-bundle:github-project` for branch protection, rulesets, CI workflow validation

A Go development review is NOT complete until all related skills have been executed.

## Core Principles

### Type Safety

- **Avoid:** `interface{}` (use `any`), `sync.Map`, scattered type assertions, reflection, `errors.As` with pre-declared variables
- **Prefer:** Generics `[T any]`, `errors.AsType[T]` (Go 1.26), concrete types, compile-time verification
- **Modernize:** Run `go fix ./...` after Go upgrades to apply automated modernizers

### Consistency

- One pattern per problem domain
- Match existing codebase patterns
- Refactor holistically or not at all

### Conventions

- Errors: lowercase, no punctuation (`errors.New("invalid input")`)
- Naming: ID, URL, HTTP (not Id, Url, Http)
- Error wrapping: `fmt.Errorf("failed to process: %w", err)`

## Quality Gates

Run these checks before completing any review:

```bash
golangci-lint run --timeout 5m    # Linting
go vet ./...                       # Static analysis
staticcheck ./...                  # Additional checks
govulncheck ./...                  # Vulnerability scan
go test -race ./...                # Race detection
```
